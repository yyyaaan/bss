title: Discussion on Performance
---

This topic discusses the performance measurement of tv-SOBI algorithm. Bootstrap results are presented in graph. 

# Background: $\boldsymbol \Omega_t$ is time-dependent

$$
\boldsymbol x_t =  \underbrace{(\boldsymbol I + t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E})\boldsymbol \Omega_0}_{\boldsymbol \Omega _t = \boldsymbol W_t ^ {-1}} \boldsymbol  z_t
$$

Due to the time-varying property, it is not sufficient to measure the performance only $\boldsymbol\Omega_0$ (initial mixing) or $\boldsymbol{ \mathcal E}$. 

Here, 3 MD values at $t=0, \ t=T/2, \ t=T$ (initial, middle and end point) are considered for simplicity. Nevertheless, the following two proposed approaches seem to be more robust,

- measuring the noise of restored sources
- average MD for all $t$, i.e. $MD_{ave} = \frac 1 T \sum\limits_{t=1}^T MD_t$ or its robust counterparts

# TV-SOBI methods: 5 types

Quadratic or Linear:

In the first step of tv-SOBI algorithm, the empirical autocovariances are "decomposed" to either two items (linear on $t$) or three times (quadratic on $t$) with minor losses.

Options in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ estimation:

Option 1 is to estimate it using first item in "decomposed autocovariance matrices"; Option 2 uses $\hat{\boldsymbol \Omega}$ to construct the "semi-empirical decomposed autocovariances", which is very similar to the first option.

The third option only available when Quadratic method is selected, as it requires the third item from step one. This option applies another joint diagnolization.

# Results

Given signal dimension of 2 (or 3), $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$ (at the level of $\boldsymbol I$) and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ (at the level of $10^{-4} \boldsymbol I$) are fixed for all simulation. The simulated mixture are the same for testing different methods, but naturally, the mixture varies between different bootstrap series.

The simulation measures the performance provided different scale of number of observations. As time-varying factor is fixed, the number indicates how much the initial and end mixing matrices differ.

Yeredor's simulation is reproduced using new performance measurement (MD).

Please note that the x-axis are exponential.

# Impression

- Estimation of $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$ is much more accurate compared with $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$, as the MD for initial are much smaller in all cases.

- Yeredor's simulation works much better than our 3-dimensional, and the behavior is actually very different.
