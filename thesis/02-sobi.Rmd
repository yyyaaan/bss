# Second Order Blind Source Separation {#sobi}

Blind Source Separation (BSS) assumes that the observed information $p$-vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a static mixture of $p$-variate latent source vector $\boldsymbol{z}$, and the basic blind source model can be written as $\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{\mu} + \boldsymbol{\Omega z}'$, where $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ denotes $p\times p$ mixing matrix, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ stands for the location (usually mean) of $\boldsymbol{x}$. This model can be easily expanded to multidimensional observations such that the $n\times p$ matrices $\boldsymbol{x}=(\boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2,\dots,\boldsymbol{x}_n)'$ and $\boldsymbol{z}=(\boldsymbol{z}_1, \boldsymbol{z}_2,\dots,\boldsymbol{z}_n)'$. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that the source signals are zero mean (in the sense that each column-vector is zero mean), and the model can be further simplified if the observations are assumed to be zero mean, which can be achieved by subtracting the location parameter, i.e. $(\boldsymbol{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{\Omega z}$. This thesis specifies the observations and signals matrices to be $n\times p$ organized in the way that each $p$-vector observation or signal is recorded as a row-vector, which is consistent with common data science programming R and Python Pandas. Finally, the basic form is,

\begin{equation}
\underset{(n\times p)}{\boldsymbol x} = \underset{(p\times p)}{\boldsymbol{\Omega}} \ \underset{(n\times p)}{\boldsymbol{z}}', \ \ \text{ where } \boldsymbol{x} \text{ has column means of }0
(\#eq:SOM)
\end{equation}

Although not mathematically required, it is assumed that $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is a full-ranked $p\times p$ matrix. In fact, an decrease in dimension of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ will allow fewer signal components (number of columns in $\boldsymbol z$) generated from the same observation $\boldsymbol{x}$. However, it is not necessary due to fact that the output carries real-world information, and the usefulness of signal components (columns) can be better determined using scientific evidence of the signal itself. Consequently, it is a justified choice to force the mixing matrix to be full-rank.

The goal of BSS is always to restore the independent source signals, and the above model assures that finding mixing matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ or unmixing matrix $\boldsymbol{W}= \boldsymbol{\Omega}^{-1}$ suffices, where the model assumption of full rank guarantees the existence of inverse matrix. For notation simplification and clarity, the following paragraphs shall only use $\boldsymbol\Omega$. The Second order BSS solves the BSS problem using second order statistics, notably measures of scale including variances, median absolute deviation and other 2nd moment estimators. The major second order blind source separation approaches include AMUSE (Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals Extraction) by Tong, Soon, Huang and Liu [@-tong1990amuse] and Second Order Blind Identification, commonly know as SOBI, was originally proposed by Belouchrani, Abed-Meraim, Cardoso and Moulines [@belouchrani1997blind].
