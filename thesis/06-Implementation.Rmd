# Implementaion of LTV-SOBI in R {#implementation}

> chapter to be improved as final steps

`R`-functions written:

- `ltvsobi(x, lags = 12, quadratic = TRUE, fix_symmetry = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)` returns list of class `tvbss` that is compatible with `JADE` pacakges's `bss` class;

- `ltvsobi2(x, lags = 12, quadratic = TRUE, fix_symmetry = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)`;

- `SIR_all(bss_res, Omega, Epsilon, S)` provides all applicable performance measurement, support both `tvbss` class and `bss` class;

- utility `tvmix(z, Omega, Epsilon, x_only = TRUE)` and `tvunmix <- function(x, Omega_hat, Epsilon_hat)`.


## Statistical Softeware Considerations

Vectorization indeed reduces the CPU time in processing compared with `for`-loops. However, vectorization and Kronecker product significantly raise the dimension of matrices in question. Therefore, the improvement in CPU time is at the cost of RAM usage, which become a problem if the dimesion is too high and crash of `R` might happen. It is advised to use  non-vectorized version for large $p$ and $T$ ($p \geq 10,\ T \geq 50000$), 

For major computer platform, linear estimation is faster and more reliable compared with inverse matrix.
