# Performance of LTV-SOBI {#performance}

The accuracy of LTV-SOBI algorithm depends mostly on the source signals and mixture themselves, especially on the assumptions of independence. Nevertheless, compared with SOBI, TV-SOBI could still be embed with more accuracy losses due to its relatively complex mixture structure and associating algorithms. Despite being mathematically negligible in each step, the potential losses can accumulate in linear estimation (RRREF), in approximate joint diagonalization (RRREF) and in searching nearest positive definite matrix for both $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ estimation.

The minimal distance index [@ilmonen2010new], denoted as $MD$, is selected to measure the accuracy of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_0$. Two types of experimental simulation are setup, with one reproducing Yeredor [@-yeredor2003tv] and the other reflecting a 3-dimensional simulated ARMA signals. In both experiments, the scale of $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is at about $10^{-4}\boldsymbol{I}$, but the change over the whole observations differs greatly as the sample size growing. For example, only about 0.01 differences in the initial mixing matrix and the end one if the time span is in total 100, but in contrast, the end mixing matrix can be 100 times larger than the initial one if 100000 samples are observed.
