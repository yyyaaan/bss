# Statistical Performance of LTV-SOBI {#performance}

The accuracy of LTV-SOBI algorithm depends mostly on the source signals and mixture themselves, especially on the assumptions of independence. Nevertheless, compared with SOBI, TV-SOBI could still be embed with more accuracy losses due to its relatively more complex mixture and associating algorithms. Despite being mathematically negligible in each step, the potential losses can accumulate in autocovariance decomposition, approximate joint diagonalization and finally separating $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ and $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$. Precision is further compromised when `nearPD` has to been applied in case of non-positive semi-definite matrices.

## Extension of Minimal Distance Index

The minimal distance index, denoted as MD, was introduce to measure the ICA algorithm performance by comparing true mixing matrix $\boldsymbol \Omega$ and estimated unmixing matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol W}$. For a non-time-varying model, MD-index is defined as [adapted @ilmonen2010new], 

\begin{equation}
\text{MD} (\widehat{ \boldsymbol {W}}) = \frac 1 {\sqrt{p-1}} \inf\limits_{ \boldsymbol C \in \mathcal C} || \boldsymbol C \widehat{ \boldsymbol {W}} \boldsymbol \Omega - \boldsymbol I_p||
(\#eq:md)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal C$ is collection matrix that allows permutation and scale ambiguity, i.e. each row and column contains exactly one non-zero element. MD-index is an elegant measure for the majority of BSS algorithm, but unfortunately it could not address the time-varying factors.

The true mixing matrix $\boldsymbol \Omega_t$ is varying over the time $t=1,2,\dots,T$, and same for $\widehat{ \boldsymbol W_1}$. Therefore, an extension to MD-index is proposed in \@ref(eq:tvmd)

\begin{equation}
\text{tvMD}(\{\widehat{ \boldsymbol W_1}, \widehat{ \boldsymbol W_2}, \dots, \widehat{ \boldsymbol W_T}\}) = \frac 1 T \sum\limits_{t=1}^T \text{MD}(\widehat{ \boldsymbol W_t})
(\#eq:tvmd)
\end{equation}

Since TV-SOBI model \@ref(eq:tvsobi) determines all $\widehat{W_t}$ by the pseudo initial mixing matrix $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$ and the time varying factor $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$, the $tvMD$ can be determined once LTV-SOBI algorithm is run, and the true mixing is known.

While tvMD is technically a mean value of MD-indecies over time, it has a value between $0$ and $1$ by central limit theorem, and the smaller the better.

## Extension of Signal-to-Inference Ratio

In information processing, researchers tends decompose the restored signals into four parts, namely target signals, interference from other sources, noise and artifacts from separation and evaluation algorithm. The decomposition can be written as [adapted @na2013performance; @vincent2006performance],

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol x = \boldsymbol s_\text{signal} + \boldsymbol s_\text{interf} + \boldsymbol e_\text{noise} + \boldsymbol e_\text{artif}
(\#eq:foursignal)
\end{equation}

The targe signal $\boldsymbol s_\text{signal}$ does not need to be exactly the source signal. Instead, certain transformation of source is allowable due to the identifiablity issue in BSS, and it is common to permit scale and permutation transform. In some literature, interference is marked as $\boldsymbol e_\text{interf}$ when false mixture of sources are regarded as error even though it originated from sources. For example, the restore series II mainly corresponds to source series IV, but also have partial mixture from source series I, which should be treated as erroneous interference. Prior BSS researches, especially among information processing domain, use Signal-to-Inference Ratio (SIR) to measure the similarity between true and restored signals [@eriksson2000source; @vincent2006performance], and its definition is,

\begin{equation}
\text{SIR}= 10 \log_{10} \frac{|| \boldsymbol s_\text{target} ||^2}{|| \boldsymbol s_\text{interf}||^2}
(\#eq:sir)
\end{equation}

The LTV-SOBI algorithm by nature does not involve any external noise, and if the noise is present in source signals, it become a part of true signals. Further, $\boldsymbol e_\text{artif}$ is asummed to be $\boldsymbol 0$ for simplicity. Assume the restored signal to be $\widehat{\boldsymbol x}$ and the permutation/scaling matrix $\boldsymbol C$ as defined in \@ref(eq:md); the signal decompose of \@ref(eq:foursignal) become,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\boldsymbol x} &= \boldsymbol {s}_\text{signal} + \boldsymbol s_\text{interf}
\\ &= \boldsymbol {Cx} + (\widehat{ \boldsymbol x} - \boldsymbol {Cx})
\end{aligned}
(\#eq:twosignal)
\end{equation}

Without doubt, time-varying factor should be considered, and the extension can be achieved by introducing a time index, i.e. $\widehat{\boldsymbol x}_t = \boldsymbol C_t \boldsymbol x_t + (\widehat{ \boldsymbol x}_t - \boldsymbol C_t \boldsymbol x_t)$. The SIR-index should also be slight modified to include convolution over $t=1,2,\dots,T$.

The SIR-index for TV-SOBI can be further simplified by taking $\boldsymbol C_t = \text{diag}( \boldsymbol \Omega_t \widehat{ \boldsymbol \Omega_t}^{-1})$ after a permutation fix. In practice, the permutation is found by arranging the numerically largest value to diagnoal position either row-by-row or column-or-column in $\boldsymbol \Omega_t \widehat{ \boldsymbol \Omega_t}^{-1}$. Finally, the time-varying SIR-index is the measure of all diagonal value agains off-diagonal items, and it is formulated as,

\begin{equation}
\text{tvSIR}= 10 \log_{10} \frac{ \sum\limits_{t=1}^T|| \text{diag}( \boldsymbol \Omega_t \widehat{ \boldsymbol \Omega_t}^{-1}) ||^2}{ \sum\limits_{t=1}^T || \text{off}( \boldsymbol \Omega_t \widehat{ \boldsymbol \Omega_t}^{-1})||^2}
(\#eq:tvsir)
\end{equation}

SIR and tvSIR does not have a direct connection to each other, but the value are comparable. SIR and tvSIR may be any real value from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, and the larger the better.

## Interim Simulation Result

Note: this section will be replaced by "better" simulation at a later stage.

There are two major differences between tvMD and tvSIR as performance measurement,

- tvMD requires the mixing system being known, i.e, true $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ must be available in addition to the source signals, while in contrast, tvSIR does not.

- the smaller tvMD guarentees a better source separation, but tvSIR is exaclty the contrast. In few prior applications, some authors prefered ISR (Interference-to-Signal Ratio) [e.g. @yeredor2003tv]; however, such has never been widely accepted.
