- Variance! boxplot!

Compared with Yeredor's original TVSOBI algorithm, LTV-SOBI eliminates one major problem of non-positive semi-definite (estimated) covariance matrix as detailed in Chapter \@ref(algorithm). Yet, LTV-SOBI algorithm does not always guarantee a solution, and it leads to a missing values in Figure \@ref(fig:resultA) to \@ref(fig:resultD). The missingness is particularily dependent on the observation, and the most significant cause is computational singularity, while in rather few cases, negative-definite covariance estimator also prohibits the execution of algorithm. Despite the mixing matrix $\boldsymbol \Omega_0$ is assumed to be full-rank, the non-singularity of every $\boldsymbol \Omega_t$ could not be assured as a result of small valued $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$. Unfortunately, computational singular issue could occur in almost every step, wherever matrix inversion is needed.

- Accuracy and number of items: mathematical correctness does not lead to emiprical accuracy

- non-stationary souces, especially ECG from health care

- Underlying assumption of linear model
