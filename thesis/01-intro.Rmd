# Introduction {#intro}

Imaging a situation that a small musical band composed of piano, bass and drum is playing at the stage, while 3 microphones are recording its performance. Rather than each microphones records one specific instrument, it can be expected that each captures slightly different mixture of the original sounds from the trio. In real-world situation, there exist diversified needs for extracting structured information from observable mixtures of unknown signals. For example, a recording of speech may contain external noise from nearby road traffic, minor discussion among audience and constant electronic interference in addition to the speech voice itself. 

In most cases, the mixing mechanism is unclear or too costly to measure, and thus it arises  a set of statistical problem to seek restoration of source signals given observed ones based on certain proper statistical assumption - independence as an example. Further, mixing mechanism is not neccassirily static; in band recording, the microphones can be moving slowly towards or against the artists due to relative movement (dancing, walking, etc.). Figure \@ref(fig:algorithm) provides a simple illustration of BSS problem.

Blind Source Separation (BSS) is set of unsupervised machine learning algorithms in terms of input being only a single data matrix. The output is usually not anticipated in advance and such algorithms mostly serve as exploratory purposes [@hyvarinen2013independent]. Compared with supervised learning like regression and classification tree, unsupervised ones are more challenging and has a tendency to be more subjective in absence of clear goal. Nevertheless, BSS and other exploratory data analysis gain increasing importance especially in online marketing and healthcare industry [@james2013introduction]. The modern information technology grants the massive quantity of data, but subtracting structural insights could be great challenge. The "blind" approaches seek to provide a first glance on big data.

This thesis expands the static source separation problem into linearly time-varying one that developed from previous researches, using relatively modern tools. A functional full implementation and relevant utilities in `R` will be produced. Proceeding chapters will first formulate the BSS problems and review established solutions, and then elaborate the linearly time-varying structure of second order source separation. Chapter \@ref(tvsobi) provides a detailed algorithm, followed by performance measurement. Finally, the thesis is concluded with discussion of potential extension and performance-related topics.
