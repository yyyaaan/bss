# Time-Varying Second Order Model Formulation

Time-varying SOBI is originally presented by Yeredor [-@yeredor2003tv], where the slow and linear change exists in mixing matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Within the SOS model \@ref(eq:SOS), the time variation can be represented as $\boldsymbol\Omega_t = (\boldsymbol I + t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E})\boldsymbol\Omega_0$, which is clearly non-constant despite $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ and $\boldsymbol\Omega_0$ are. Figure \@ref(fig:mixingplot) illustrates the difference between ordinary time-invariant mixture and time-varying one. It can be discovered that the time-varying mixture has a certain trend and it does not demonstrate the stationary property. In fact, introduction of time varying factor invalids the stationary property in the observation $\boldsymbol{x}$ almost surely even though the source signals are stationary. This is because $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ changes the scale (second order statistics) over time $t$. Nevertheless, aforementioned SOBI and the upcoming TV-SOBI do not require such property in observation.

```

The TV-SOBI model below \@ref(eq:tvsobi) is an extension to the SOS model \@ref(eq:SOS), and similar to it, the first assumption is non-restrictive and can be achieved through simple data transformation; the second is required to tackle the ambiguity of BSS, while the third assumption states both stationary and independent characteristics. The final assumption is optional in ensuring that the change of mixing is rather slow, and otherwise, the mixture is not a meaningful as a BSS problem [adapted @yeredor2003tv].

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
  \boldsymbol x_t =  ( \boldsymbol I + t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E})\boldsymbol \Omega_0 \boldsymbol  z_t
\\ (1)\ & E( \boldsymbol z_t) = \boldsymbol 0 
\\ (2)\ & E( \boldsymbol z_t \boldsymbol z_t') = \text{Cov}( \boldsymbol z_t) = \boldsymbol I
\\ (3)\ & E( \boldsymbol z_t \boldsymbol z_{t+\tau}') = \boldsymbol\Lambda_\tau \text{ diagonal for all }
\tau = 1,2,\dots
\\ *(4)\ & \boldsymbol{\mathcal E} << \boldsymbol I 
\end{aligned}
