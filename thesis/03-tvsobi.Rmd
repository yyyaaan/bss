# TV-SOBI Algorithm based on Autocovariances {#tvsobi}

Compared with SOBI, TV-SOBI usually demands one more matrix to be effectively estimated, the linear time varying mixing factor $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ in addition to the initial mixing matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_0$.

Joint Diagnolization approach to Time Varying Second Order Blind Identification (TV-SOBI) covers thhe solution that mainly includes 3 statistical steps using empirical autocovariance matrices and applying joint diagonalization after applicable linear estimation. Simple matrix operation is further needed to retrieve the source signals.

Similar to model fitting in time series analysis, the desired lags must be chosen in advance based on the data characteristics (for example acf-function), and let the selected set of lags $L = \{l_1, l_2,\dots, l_{k}\}$.
