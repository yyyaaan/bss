# Time-Varying Second Order Model Formulation {#tvsobi}

Time-varying SOBI (TV-SOBI) is originally presented by Yeredor [-@yeredor2003tv], where the slow change exists in mixing matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Within the SOS model \@ref(eq:SOS), linear time variation can be represented as $\boldsymbol\Omega_t = (\boldsymbol I + t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E})\boldsymbol\Omega_0$, which is clearly non-constant despite $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ and $\boldsymbol\Omega_0$ are. Other time-varying structure inlcuding peroidical [@weisman2006separation], geometric curved [@kaftory2007probabilistic]. Figure \@ref(fig:mixingplot) illustrates the difference between ordinary time-invariant mixture and linearly time-varying one. It can be discovered that the time-varying mixture has a certain trend and it does not demonstrate the stationary property. In fact, introduction of time varying factor invalids the stationary property in the observation $\boldsymbol{x}$ almost surely even though the source signals are stationary. This is because $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ changes the scale (second order statistics) over time $t$. Nevertheless, aforementioned SOBI and the upcoming LTV-SOBI algorithms do not require such property in observation

## LTV-SOBI Model and Assumptions

Linearly Time-Varying Second Order Blind Identification (LTV-SOBI) model below \@ref(eq:tvsobi) can be viewed an extension to the SOS model \@ref(eq:SOS) and also a special case TV-SOBI where the time-dependent variation are assumed to be linear, and similar to it, the first assumption is non-restrictive and can be achieved through simple data transformation; the second is required to tackle the ambiguity of BSS, while the third assumption states both stationary and uncorrelated characteristics. The final assumption is optional in ensuring that the change of mixing is rather slow, and otherwise, the mixture is not a meaningful as a BSS problem [adapted @yeredor2003tv].

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
  \boldsymbol x_t =  ( \boldsymbol I + t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E})\boldsymbol \Omega_0 \boldsymbol  z_t
\\ (1)\ & \mathbb E( \boldsymbol z_t) = \boldsymbol 0 
\\ (2)\ & \mathbb E( \boldsymbol z_t \boldsymbol z_t') = \text{Cov}( \boldsymbol z_t) = \boldsymbol I
\\ (3)\ & \mathbb E( \boldsymbol z_t \boldsymbol z_{t+\tau}') = \boldsymbol\Lambda_\tau \text{ diagonal for all }
\tau = 1,2,\dots
\\ *(4)\ & \boldsymbol{\mathcal E} << \boldsymbol I 
\end{aligned}
(\#eq:tvsobi)
\end{equation}

It should be noted that the model assumes uncorrelatedness instead of independence in pre-centered source signals, formally, the pearson correlation between different dimensions are always 0, or $\mathbb E[\boldsymbol S_i \boldsymbol S_j] = 0$ for all $i\neq j$. It is a relatively less-restrictive condition as independence implies uncorrelatedness and the opposite is not true in general [e.g. @papoulis2002probability].
