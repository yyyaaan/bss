# Abstract {-}

Blind source separation (BSS) seeks to recover the true signals from the only observed values, the multivariate time-series mixture, and usually no prior information (blind) about the mixing matrix is available. There are various methodologies established to solve the BSS problems, and notably SOBI seeks to identify sources through the spatial independence in second order statistics. This paper extends the Second Order Source Separation (SOS) model   in terms of hidden time variation in mixing, as initially introduced by Yeredor (2003), and presents TV-SOBI procedure aiming to estimate through joint diagonalization the time-varying unmixing matrices and ultimately derives the latent independent sources. The generalized TV-SOBI will be covered in non-linear time variation and non-stationary source signals, and finally attempts towards the corresponding unsupervised machine learning with tensorial time-series. The performance of TV-SOBI will be analyzed with simulated data and compared to other most common BSS methods. 

# Notations and Symbols {-}

Vectors and matrices are always marked as bold symbols while a lower case letter stands for a numeric value. The most commonly used symbols are summarized below.

| Symbol | Meaning | Note |
|---|---|---|
| $\boldsymbol I$ | identity matrix| compatible dimensions are assigned|
| $\boldsymbol z$ | source signals| $p\times T$ matrix or $p$-vector |
| $\boldsymbol x$ | observed signals| $p\times T$ matrix or $p$-vector |
| $\boldsymbol\mu$ | row means of a matrix   |  vector  |
| $\boldsymbol\Omega_t$ | mixing matrix at given time point $t$ | $p\times p$ matrix. $\boldsymbol\Omega_t = ( \boldsymbol I+t \boldsymbol{\mathcal E}) \boldsymbol\Omega$ |
| $\boldsymbol\Omega$ | mixing matrix at $t=0$ | $\boldsymbol\Omega \overset{\text{def}}= \boldsymbol\Omega_0$ |
| $\boldsymbol{\mathcal E}$ |time-varying mixing factor | $p\times p$ matrix |
| $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\tau}$ | autocovariance given stationarity | $p\times p$ matrix that depends only on lag $\tau$ and assumed to be diagonal |
| $\boldsymbol R_{\tau} = \boldsymbol{\Omega \Lambda}_{\tau} \boldsymbol\Omega'$ | partially mixed autocovariance  | $p\times p$, a short-hand notation|
| $\boldsymbol K ^{(p,p)}$ | commutation matrix | $p^2\times p^2$ |
| $t=1,2,\dots,T$ | index of time | use in subscript. $t=0$ is a pseudo notation. | 
| $\tau \in \{0\}\bigcup L$ | pre-selected time lag | An integer. 0 is included for covenience |
| $L = \{\tau_1,\tau_2,\dots,\tau_l\}$ | set of pre-selected lags | $l$-item set of positive integers |


- the operator $\boldsymbol{A}'$ stands for matrix transpose; 
- matrix subscript $\boldsymbol{A}_t$ returns the $t$-th row vector of $\boldsymbol{A}$;
- the function $\text{vec}( \boldsymbol A)$ defines vectorization (by-column) of $\boldsymbol A$;
- the operator $\otimes$ is Kronecker product.
- matrix index $\boldsymbol{A}[i,j]$ gives the number in the $i$-th row $j$-th column of matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$.
