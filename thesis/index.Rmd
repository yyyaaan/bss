# Abstract {-}

Blind source separation (BSS) seeks to recover the true signals from the only observed values, the multivariate time-series mixture, and no prior information (blind) about the mixing matrix is available. There are various methodologies established to solve the BSS problems, and notably, Second-Order Blind Identification (SOBI) identifies sources through spatial independence in second-order statistics. This thesis stretches the Second Order Source Separation (SOS) model in terms of latent time variation in mixing that was initially proposed by Yeredor (2003). An improved algorithm, Linearly Time-Varying SOBI (LTV-SOBI), together with alternatives attempts to estimate mixing parameters and ultimately derives the latent independent sources by means of autocovariance decomposition and joint diagonalization. The performance of LTV-SOBI will be analyzed with simulated data and it proves a positive improvement with prior methodologies.
