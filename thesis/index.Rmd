# Abstract {-}

Blind source separation (BSS) seeks to recover the true signals from the only observed values, the multivariate time-series mixture, and usually no prior information (blind) about the mixing matrix is available. There are various methodologies established to solve the BSS problems, and notably SOBI seeks to identify sources through the spatial independence in second order statistics. This paper extends the Second Order Source Separation (SOS) model   in terms of hidden time variation in mixing, as initially introduced by Yeredor (2003), and presents TV-SOBI procedure aiming to estimate through joint diagonalization the time-varying unmixing matrices and ultimately derives the latent independent sources. The generalized TV-SOBI will be covered in non-linear time variation and non-stationary source signals, and finally attempts towards the corresponding unsupervised machine learning with tensorial time-series. The performance of TV-SOBI will be analyzed with simulated data and compared to other most common BSS methods. 

# Notations and Symbols {-}

- vectors and matrices are always in bold symbols; 
- the operator $\boldsymbol{A}'$ stands for matrix transpose; 
- matrix index $\boldsymbol{A}[i,j]$ gives the number in the $i$-th row $j$-th column of matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$;
- matrix subscript $\boldsymbol{A}_t$ returns the $t$-th row vector of $\boldsymbol{A}$.
